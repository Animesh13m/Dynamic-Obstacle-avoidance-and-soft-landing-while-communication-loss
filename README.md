# Robust Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance and Autonomous Soft Landing of a Quadcopter under OptiTrack Communication Loss

## Overview

This repository contains the code, Simulink models, and supporting documentation for the Master thesis project focused on enhancing UAV robustness through intelligent fallback mechanisms, safe descent strategies, and real-time image processing. The project was developed using MATLAB/Simulink and tested on the Quanser QDrone platform with OptiTrack motion capture integration.
