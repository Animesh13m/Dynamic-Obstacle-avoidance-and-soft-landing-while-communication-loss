## 4.2.2 Throttle Optimization Formulation

### üöÅ Problem Overview
The UAV's collision-free height regulation is framed as a **bounded nonlinear optimization problem**. Using **Brent‚Äôs Method**, the throttle `u` is dynamically optimized to ensure accurate height tracking and obstacle avoidance, especially near hazards.

---

### üß† Cost Function

The optimization goal is:

\[
\min_u J(u) = w_h e_h^2 + w_u \Delta u^2 + w_o \sigma(d) u^2 + w_v [\dot{u}]^+
\]

**Subject to:**  
\[
u_{\min} \leq u \leq u_{\max}
\]

Where:  
- \( e_h = z(t) - z_{\text{ref}} \): Height tracking error  
- \( \Delta u = u - u_{\text{nom}} \): Throttle deviation  
- \( [\dot{u}]^+ = \max(0, \dot{u}) \): Penalizes abrupt throttle increase  
- \( \sigma(d) = \begin{cases} 100, & d < 0.3\text{ m} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \): Obstacle penalty  
- Bounds: \( u_{\min}, u_{\max} \in [12.5, 13.6] \)

### ‚úÖ Why Brent‚Äôs Method?

- **Continuity**: The cost function is continuous, even with piecewise and non-differentiable terms.
- **Unimodal Nature**: Dominated by quadratic terms, leading to a well-defined minimum.
- **Derivative-Free**: Suitable for non-smooth problems where gradients are unavailable.
- **Bounded Domain**: Works efficiently within defined throttle limits.

## 4.3 Brent‚Äôs Method for Optimization

**Brent‚Äôs Method** combines the reliability of **Golden-Section Search (GSS)** with the speed of **Successive Parabolic Interpolation (SPI)**. It adaptively chooses between the two based on the local behavior of the cost function.

This hybrid approach ensures fast, reliable convergence ‚Äî making it ideal for real-time throttle optimization in embedded UAV systems.

---

### üîß Key Techniques

- **SPI**: Fits a parabola through three points to estimate the minimum. Offers fast convergence near smooth regions.
- **GSS**: Uses the golden ratio to narrow down the minimum in uncertain or non-smooth regions.

Brent‚Äôs Method enables real-time, safe, and efficient throttle control for UAVs, ensuring stable height tracking and effective obstacle avoidance in bounded and non-smooth environments.
