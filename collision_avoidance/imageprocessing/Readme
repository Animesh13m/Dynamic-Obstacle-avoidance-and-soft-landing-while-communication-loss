To enhance onboard perception for collision avoidance and safe landing, an RGB-D front-facing
camera is integrated using the Video3D Initialize and Video3D Capture blocks from the
QUARC Multimedia library. This configuration provides synchronized RGB images and depth
data, enabling real-time spatial awareness for obstacle detection, surface mapping, and precise
landing execution during autonomous UAV operations.

Initialize and capture should syncronuse with each other to further analyse and process image data.
